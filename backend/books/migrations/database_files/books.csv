/works/OL5016825W;/authors/OL1089671A;The pansy speaker;"I found the book  ""The Pansy Speaker"" in my deceased father’s family collection. The Pansy Speaker: Little Verses for Little Girls, has a pretty little girl in a blue dress and hat in a daisy patch on the inside cover titled “ I am a Little Fairy.”            A LIT-TLE FAIR-Y  I am a lit-tle fair-y     I flut-ter to and fro  (At least, if fair-ies flut-ter---     I think they do, you know!).    I am a lit-tle fiar-y,      I flit-ter here and there   (Do fair-ies real-ly flit-ter?     I don’t know, I de-clare).    There’s one thing I must men-tion,     And then a-way I’ll go:  I am a lit-tle fair-y---     I thought you’d like to know!             The books consists of several poems for small children many only a few verses long. Such poems as:  For a Very Little Girl, For a Tiny Tot, What is the Use, Mary’s Little Lamb, Our Girl’s Rabbits, Baby, Little Things, Kind Words, Dolly Town, My Dear Kitty, To the Pansy, Little Bo-Peep,  and The Rose; to name a few.     “Little Bo Peep: Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep, and can’t tell where to find them; Leave them alone, and they’ll come home And bring their tails behind them.  	Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep, and dreamed she heard them bleating, But when she awoke, ‘twas all a joke – Atlas! They still were fleeting.  	Then up she took her little crook, determined for to find them; She found them, indeed, but it made her heart bleed, They’d left their tails behind them.  	It happened one day, as Bo-Peep did stray Over the meadows hard by, That there she espied their tails side by side, All hung on a tree to dry.   She heaved a sigh, and gave by-and –by Each careless sheep a banging;  And as for the rest she thought it was best just to leave their tails a-hanging.”  “Mary’s Little lamb  Mary had a little lamb Whose fleece was white as snow, And everywhere that Mary went That lamb is would not go;  So Mary took that little Lamb And put it on the spit, And soon it was so nicely done She ate it every bit. “"

National identity has been a central theme throughout the centuries in a country where economic, political, and social issues have tended to be closely bound up with questions of national mentality and emotion. This book examines the part played by Scottish newspapers in constructing identity during a key period of the devolution process, 1997-2011. It uses insights from the fields of linguistics, sociology and cognitive science on the construction of culturally defined knowledge and the notions of identity that emerge from it. The study contributes to the understanding of Scottish identity, and its evaluations are relevant beyond the immediate context of Scotland and the United Kingdom""--Provided by publisher."

Do the existing Targums link up with an oral translation of Scripture and, if so, how far does it go back? Do the Targums transmit traditional exegetical material in a distinct form? What is the relation between the Targums and ""parabiblical"" literature of the Second Temple period (including the New Testament)? In the present volume, these and other questions are studied and debated by an international group of scholars including some of the best specialists of Targumic literature in all its diversity, as well as specialists of various Second Temple writings""--"

In the last ten years, the artist has completed fifty large-scale abstract outdoor installation artworks, one hundred table pieces, and numerous steel engravings and digital prints. His sculptures are constructed from stainless steel, weathered and rusting steel, road plate, scrap metal, discards from a nuclear power plant, and blacksmithing and mechanic's tools. The complex geometries of the stainless pieces borrow, reflect, alter, and absorb nature's light to create a multiplicity of color fields. The rusting, weathered artworks produce complex, multiple, and sometimes playful narratives. - Mailing insert.

Tufte. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey : Prentice-Hall,   1974. x + 179 pp.       ""Edward R. Tufte's book ***Data Analysis for Politics and Policy*** is, quite simply, excellent. The aims of the author in the writing of this book is ""is to present fundamental material not found in statistics books, and in particular, to show techniques of ***quantitative analysis in action*** on problems of politics and policy"" (p. ix). To achieve this end, Tufte considers a narrow range of important topics in statistical analysis, primarily dealing with problems Of prediction (including a good discussion of the concept of causation) and the relationships among variables through simple and multiple regression.     Most of the ideas discussed are presented in several detailed examples.   For example, much of the first chapter explores the relationship, causal or otherwise, between mandatory motor vehicle inspection and deaths due to automobile accidents. This example begins with an interesting problem and then suggests a collection Of data to study it (i.e., data on 49 states for the years 1966—68). Problems, such as units of measurements, causation vs. association, and the types Of inference possible from such data, naturally arise.   Tufte leads the reader through a ***systematic analysis*** and, by presenting the raw data in the text, leaves the reader to pursue the problem. The bulk Of the book concerns the use and interpretation of simple and multiple regression. Here, the discussion centers on issues that, as Tufte claims, *do not usually find a place* in standard statistics texts.   For example, in simple regression, the book stresses the central role of residuals and residual analysis, and describes many of the measures familiar to social scientists, r2, S2Y/X, etc., as functions of the residuals, ""…since reasonable measures Of the quality of a line's fit to the data could hardly be anything but a function of the magnitudes Of the errors"" (page 70).     Tufte puts residual plots to good use to gain understanding of a data set, and he shows how finding outliers gives the analyst hints about the inadequacy Of a statistical model. This attitude is clearly passed along to the reader. The discussion Of graphical techniques in general is quite good and includes the reproduction of graphs of several scatter plots with the same regression line from [1].     Other topics in simple regression are also considered. A brief but compelling discussion of the ""value of data as evidence,"" with regard to the interpretation of nonrandom samples, is presented. An important discussion of the usefulness of computing slopes instead of correlation coefficients is given, complete with a good quote from John Tukey.       Several examples requiring transformations Of one or both variables to the logarithmic scale are given, along with an interpretation of transformed variables.     The section on **transformations** is difficult for many students, but it contains information that is not usually available to the beginning nontechnical student. The presentation of multiple regression is rather brief. There is sufficient content for the reader to appreciate multiple regression, but not really enough to actually do it. The discussion concentrates on the meaning of several predictors for a single response variable and on ways to understand complicated relationships.     There is also a fine discussion of **multicollinearity**.   The examples of the use of **multiple regression** are rather small, but I have found them useful in classes since the reader can reproduce the analysis with a minimum of effort. The book was probably intended to be used in quantitative-methods courses in political science, public affairs or similar fields. For the last two years, I have use it as a supplemental text in a demanding statistics service course for first year social science graduate students. The book has received almost uniform praise from the students involved. "" --  ---  SANFORD WEISBERG   University Of Minnesota     REFERENCE   [1] Anscombe, F.J..

/works/OL2824004W;/authors/OL421269A;Political control of the economy;Speculations about the effects of politics on economic life have a long and vital tradition, but few efforts have been made to determine the precise relationship between them. Edward Tufte, a political scientist who covered the 1976 Presidential election for Newsweek, seeks to do just that. His sharp analyses and astute observations lead to an eye-opening view of the impact of political life on the national economy of America and other capitalist democracies.    The analysis demonstrates how politicians, political parties, and voters decide who gets what, when, and how in the economic arena. A nation's politics, it is argued, shape the most important aspects of economic life--inflation, unemployment, income redistribution, the growth of government, and the extent of central economic control. Both statistical data and case studies (based on interviews and Presidential documents) are brought to bear on four topics.   They are:   1) the political manipulation of the economy in election years,   2) the new international electoral-economic cycle,   3) the decisive role of political leaders and parties in shaping macroeconomic outcomes, and   4) the response of the electorate to changing economic conditions.     Finally, the book clarifies a central question in political economy: How can national economic policy be conducted in both a democratic and a competent fashion?
/works/OL2824005W;/authors/OL421269A;The quantitative analysis of social problems;"WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT:   Tufte shows how to examine data for quality and ""truthiness"". Tufte also shows how to ""design"" information to turn meaningless data into meaningful, usable information--which could improve your career, or help the war on ""Fake News"".     Due to the cost-cutting elimination of many fact-checkers and overseers of information quality & ethics in newsagencies, corporations, and schools, many people are losing important tools for critical thinking ie. being able to tell or comprehend ""real truths"" versus ""fake"" information. This affects everybody's freedom by manipulating the public, voting, and whether they can protect themselves from fraudsters.      ABSTRACT:  Solving Social Problems using data analysis; Intro to How to use Data Analysis, Predictions and projections: some issues of research design...    ""PREFACE   If you want to understand and solve social problems, a good first step toward these goals is to master the quantitative ideas in this collection Of papers. The readings show What quantitative analysis is good for and how it can be Criticized and improved. Included, then, are a number of well-executed studies of important social, economic, and political problems: equality of educational opportunity, voting behavior, poverty, automobile accidents, smoking and health, and so forth. Other papers center on data analysis, research design, and statistical criticism. Many Of the papers either are published here for the first time or have been relatively inaccessible. Thus the collection should prove enlightening to those who want access to the more quantitative studies Of social problems as well as to those studying statistics and data analysis in the social sciences.      The collection is divided into five parts:   *Statistical Evidence and Statistical Criticism.   *Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Studies.   *Economic and Aggregate Analysis.   *Survey Data.   *Data Analysis and Research Design.     The first three readings are careful and judicious assessments of quantitative work. They discuss controversial and sometimes difficult studies: Sexual Be- havior in the Human Male by Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin; a political tract called ""Catholic Voters and the Democratic National Ticket""; and studies of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer.     The fourth paper in this section, growing out of some of the criticisms of the research on smoking and health, suggests a number of ground rules for statistical criticism. All these readings are valuable, it seems to me, because, by their example, they help us to arrive at sensible evaluations of quantitative studies. The discussion by Cochran, Mosteller, and Tukey Of ""Sexual Behavior in The Human Male"" reaches a balanced conclusion about a flawed but highly significant study. The paper by Cornfield, Haenszel, Hammond, Lilienfeld, Shimkin, and Wynder pulls together many different types of evidence about the consequences of smoking. Their work is especially valuable because of its stress on the logic of inference and the logic of counterexplanation. ……….

In addition to these findings, environmental justice literature demonstrates that not all populations will be affected equally: communities of color and lower socioeconomic backgrounds are exposed to greater risks. While urban planners are proposing initiatives ranging from resiliency reports to design solutions, there is little attention towards land use regulations as a way to reduce vulnerability. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how land use affects the social vulnerability of neighborhoods in New York City towards sea level rise. The findings of the quantitative analysis suggest that residential use and industrial use pose a strong relationship with vulnerability towards sea level rise. Through the use of qualitative methods, my research provides policy recommendations that incorporate environmental justice to address risk of those who are most vulnerable. These include considering inequitable zoning in industrial use areas and incorporating sea level rise into different types of residential densities.  This framework provides the tools for addressing mitigation strategies through an equitable and long-term perspective.

In this second volume, 'The Illusion of An Everlasting Summer', we follow Guillermina and Belinda from ages 14 to 24 as they negotiate the fluid territory between adolescence and young adulthood. Still surrounded by the animals and rural settings of their childhood, 'Everlasting Summer' depicts the two cousins' everyday lives as they experience young love, pregnancy, and motherhood - all of which, perhaps inevitably, results in an ever-increasing independence from their families and each other. Similarly, we can sense a shift in Sanguinetti's relationship to the cousins and the work they make: from insular childhood collaborators to three women with lives branching in different directions. Though the passage of time is one of the most palpable tensions at work in these photographs, 'An Everlasting Summer' deepens Sanguinetti's exploration of the timeless, universal language of female intimacy and friendship. MACK will be publishing an ongoing series of formally similar volumes from the body of work 'The Adventures of Guille and Belinda', commencing with a reprint of the first book 'The Adventures of Guille and Belinda and the Enigmatic Meaning of Their Dreams' in early 2021--Provided by publisher.

/works/OL4331592W;/authors/OL844987A;Remember the Days;This is an inspiring nostalgic novel set in northern Iowa during the homesteading period of the 1880's. Based on journals kept by the author's Aunt Ann and narrated by her, it tells her own story of growing up on the open prairie, and of her four sisters who also resented the harshness of the land and its unreasonable demands up on all of them.    Primarily it is the story of her parents, Sam and Molly Bullard, and of her mother's valiant struggle to wrest a measure of comfort for her family from a primitive environment while holding on to the gentler things of life to which she had been accustomed through her own youth in Virginia. For these Molly Bullard fought the land and the elements against tremendous odds, and often the stubborn foolhardiness of her husband whom she loved.

From there, on June 30, he wrote a letter that conveys vividly how much the letters he received from Nikki meant to him, as well as how much he was hoping that she would decide, before long, that he was the one for her:    *My Dearest Nikki:  I fell upon your letter today like a ton of bricks. The blue envelope has become well known and its arrival is heralded far and wide. The biggest events in my life right now are the comings of your thoughts. With all this other stuff going one. I can truthfully say your letters men more than all of it. Not just the fact of receiving word from you, but the idea of being closer to you... I search each and every letter for slightest indication that you have decided. Before, we may have had two little time to decide if what we felt was love, but I've thought of you far too often and yearned to be with you for too much  for it to be anything else as far as I'm concerned.  However, I can afford to commit myself, while it's definitely not the best idea for you. It's a dangerous game we play and one's number can be up almost anytime. Such unpleasant closeness to death and scenes of it around you don't increase your bravery or eating abilities. I'm satisfied though, now, that I can do my job in the face of it and that's the main thing. No matter what anyone thinks, you must be satisfied yourself of your never before you can feel content You'd be surprised how much you help*    One the fourth of July, the Eighty-third Division began its attach on the entrenched Germans in the hedgerow county of Normandy....
/works/OL14933002W;/authors/OL2631209A;Beyond a Reasonable Doubt;This phrase, heard countless times every day in American courtrooms across the country, sets forth the burden of proof placed upon the prosecution in a criminal trial. Yet this cherished principle is not mentioned in the Constitution, nor is it defined by any laws. What, then, does beyond a reasonable doubt really mean, and how should it be interpreted and applied? In Beyond a Reasonable Doubt more than 80 distinguished contributors reflect on what this standard really means and how it is applied. Brilliantly dissecting its meaning from every angle, attorneys, judges, novelists, journalists, religious leaders and convicted felons shine a light on the most compelling standard in our legal system.

The result is REMEMBER ME WHEN I'M GONE, an entertaining and eloquent collection of  ""last words"" from people in the arts, in politics, in sports, and in business, mostly still alive. In telling and moving reflections, often leavened by self-deprecating humor, these celebrities look back on their lives, their ambitions, their mistakes, and their accomplishments.The contributions range from pithy one-liners by Yogi Berra (""It's over.""), Dave Barry, George Carlin, and Liz Smith (""Excuse my dust!""); to inspired sketches by Stephen King and Peter Falk; to candid reflections from Don Shula, Fred Rogers, and Chevy Chase; to hilarious rants from Margaret Cho and Tommy Lee; and a last request by Arthur Hailey. Often surprising and always memorable, REMEMBER ME WHEN I'M GONE is a timeless collection by stars who will live on forever."

For The People's Princess, Larry King asked many people who knew Diana, some officially and some more personally, for their favorite memories.Sir Richard Branson recalls Diana sitting in the cockpit of one of his private planes with baby Prince William on her lap; as they flew past Windsor Castle she announced, ""On our right you have Grandma's house!"" Heather Mills, who, like Diana, has been a tireless campaigner for charitable causes, recalls Diana's work to eradicate the scourge of land mines, as well as the time she was photographed shaking hands with an AIDS patient in a London hospital, doing so much to counteract the stigma associated with the disease at the time. British radio and television personality Chris Tarrant recalls how clearly nervous he was upon meeting Diana for the first time, and how she put him at ease with an incredibly rude joke about Kermit the Frog. Photographer Tim Graham remembers Diana lying on the floor with baby William in order to coax a smile from the young prince. And her chief bodyguard recalls how happy and at peace she seemed on the day he agreed to her simple request: to be allowed to walk, truly alone for once, along a beautiful, deserted beach.Some of these recollections are warm and intimate, celebrating Diana for her ability to make a human connection with everyone she met, others are perceptive and revealing, even about Diana's human failings and frailties. Together, they coalesce into a multifaceted portrait of a woman that the world has long desired to know a little better.From the Hardcover edition."

/works/OL22465382W;/authors/OL8596621A;GRAIL;"""In September 2011, the GRAIL mission launched two unmanned spacecraft to the Moon, which entered into lunar orbit on December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2012. They orbited the Moon until December 17, 2012, when they impacted the surface near the Moon's north pole. This book contains three review articles co-authored by the GRAIL Science Team and Guest Scientists that describe the reasons for the GRAIL mission, the development of the necessary technology, and the design of the mission to acquire the most precise measurements of the lunar gravity field possible today. The book provides a detailed description of the GRAIL mission's scientific objectives, the instrumentation and its required performance, the complex simulation of the measurement system for determining the gravity field, and the innovative education and public outreach of the mission directed toward middle-school students who could select areas of the Moon for imaging with the onboard MoonKam camera system. This volume is aimed at researchers and graduate students active in solar system science and planetology""--"

Les uns sont occitans, les autres français. Leur réunion fait ressortir les différences d'esprit et de ton, mais aussi la continuité entre les deux littératures de la France médiévale. Certains des ces récits sont très connus, comme Aucassin et Nicolette. D'autres sont à découvrir. Ils ne relèvent pas d'un genre littéraire unique, circonscrit et défini. Mais le même espirt les anime, fait d'une soumission grave et souriante au raffinement des manières et à la violence de l'amour.

Eleanor, a harried, middle-aged White female elementary schoolteacher (and former police officer), begins her day by dying in the year 1999. Somehow, while her essence is en route to wherever one?s essence goes upon death, she inadvertently ends up occupying the body of a 16-year-old Black male in 1858 Philadelphia. Not only does she have to deal with the obvious gender, race, and time period changes, but she also has to figure out whether, when lives are at stake, she should interfere with history as she knows it.

And that's why it may come as a surprise to hear that there are still sides of this fiftysomething (!) devoted mother and dedicated television personality yet to be revealed.Just When I Thought I'd Dropped My Last Egg is Kathie Lee's triumphant, laugh-out-loud celebration of forging ahead with gusto, even long after we're old enough to know better. Over the years, Kathie Lee has learned a lot about life and about herself. Age, for instance, isn't a number, it's a state of mind, and being fertile isn't just about having babies. Perhaps most important: Our quality of life is sustained by our passions--how we express, define, and even reinvent ourselves at any age, through our careers, interests, friends, and beliefs. It's never too late to set new goals for yourself and strive to meet them, to dust off your childhood dreams and pursue them again, to wake up every morning hoping to learn something new. In this riotous collection of musings, observations, and life lessons, Kathie Lee shares her thoughts about marriage, parenthood, friendship, faith, pet peeves, senior moments, and how to extricate oneself from potentially hairy situations with self-deprecating wit. Writing with the candor of a friend who knows where the bodies are buried, Kathie Lee reveals the truth every woman of a certain age knows but won't admit: that we love our kids every second of every day but are counting the minutes till they're ready to go off to college, that even though gravity is a constant force, not all parts of our bodies droop at the same rate, and that life and show business share one simple rule: ""Don't sit by the phone and wait for a man or a job.""Full of warmth, humor, down-to-earth wisdom, and more than a little bit of dish, Just When I Thought I'd Dropped My Last Egg is a delectable read for grown-ups of all ages.From the Hardcover edition."

The zine opens with the Spanish Wikipedia page introducing the scam and is followed by an email from Sandra James, a 22-year-old student from the Ivory Coast whose father, a reputable gold miner, has mysteriously died during a work trip. She suspects he has been killed by her uncle who was with him. Sandra explains that as his only daughter he has left her a large sum of money that she cannot retrieve due to the political crisis and fear of her uncle, who is after the money. She asks two favors of the email recipients: to transfer the money to their account and assist with the property investments as required by her fathers will as well as to help her attain permanent residence in their country while this is carried out. In return for these favors, Sandra offers 20% of the inheritance. María Isabel responds to the emails entertaining the request asking for photos and further information, and through their exchanges it becomes apparent that the emails are a scam to obtain María Isabel's bank account and personal information. The zine includes the original email texts and attachments that Sandra sent to María. — Nayla Delgado  Este zine presenta los correos electrónicos de la Estafa Nigeriana 419. El zine se abre con la página de Wikipedia en español que presenta la estafa y es seguido por un correo electrónico de Sandra James, una estudiante de 22 años de Costa de Marfil. Se supone que su padre, un minero reputado de oro, ha muerto misteriosamente durante un viaje de trabajo. Ella sospecha que ha sido asesinado por su tío que estaba con él. Sandra le explica que, como única hija, le ha dejado una gran suma de dinero que no puede recuperar debido a la crisis política y al miedo de su tío que va detrás del dinero. A cambio de unos cuantos favores para ayudarla recibir su suma, Sandra ofrece el 20% de la herencia. María Isabel responde a los correos electrónicos entreteniendo la propuesta y pidiendo fotos y más información, y a través de sus intercambios se hace evidente que los correos electrónicos son una estafa para obtener la cuenta bancaria y la información personal de María Isabel. El zine incluye los textos originales de los correos electrónicos y los archivos adjuntos que Sandra envió a María. (Transl. by Nayla Delgado)

But, the question involves more than politics and emotion; it includes such critical issues as law, justice, human rights, human dignity, and freedom. Strangers in This World is a collection that brings together an international consortium of scholars to reflect on the religious, political, anthropological, and social realities of immigration through the prism of the historical and theological resources, insights, and practices across an array of religious traditions. The volume, reflecting the diversity of religious cultures, is nevertheless unified in arguing that immigration is an important aspect of the major religions and is found at their core. The contributors unfold this important dimension of the religious traditions and explore the ways that the theme of immigration connects to vital points of theological reflection and practice in Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Native American religious traditions. At root, the volume is about our collective journey together as immigrant peoples who have stories and settlements to share, as well as challenges and struggles to overcome, that may be faced through the resources our many faiths offer."

Many would stay that way for months and years as advertisers had no interest targeting a much depopulated city beset and preoccupied with basic concerns. Closer to the ground, language sprouted. Ugly mass-produced plastic signs advertising recovery services proliferated and many took matters into their own hands: with a can of spray paint, shard of plywood and a useful service to proclaim, a person was in business. This book promotes those efforts and imagines the billboard as a civic witness, memorial, reflection and marquee for stories from an extraordinary time."

Often portrayed as larger-than-life characters, these outlaw figures and their bloodthirsty exploits have long been immortalized in fiction and film. But beneath the legends is the true story of these brigands -- often common men and women escaping the social and economic restrictions of 18th-century Europe and America.

La Renaissance reprend à son compte cette question débattue depuis le 'Philèbe' et le livre X de l''Ethique à Nicomaque'. Au XVe siècle, Lorenzo Valla, dans son dialogue 'Sur le Plaisir' (1430), tranche dans le sens d'une identification entre le plaisir et le Bien. Il est suivi un siècle plus tard par Érasme qui n'hésite pas, dans l''Epicurien' (1533), à assimiler le Christ à Épicure. Et Montaigne, dans sa critique du stoïcisme, stigmatise le danger des vertus immodérées qui excluent le plaisir. ... Réhabiliter le plaisir, c'est pouvoir assumer sa part d'ombre, le déplaisir, refuser l'abstraction de leur dissociation. Accepter le plaisir, c'est accepter la mort. C'est l'une des leçons paradoxales de ""Peines d'Amour Perdues"" que la pensée baroque ne cessera d'illustrer""--P. [4] of cover."

/works/OL32688344W;/authors/OL11868423A;Augmented Reality Interfaces for Enabling Fast and Accurate Task Localization;Changing viewpoints is a common technique to gain additional visual information about the spatial relations among the objects contained within an environment. In many cases, all of the necessary visual information is not available from a single vantage point, due to factors such as occlusion, level of detail, and limited field of view. In certain instances, strategic viewpoints may need to be visited multiple times (e.g., after each step of an iterative process), which makes being able to transition between viewpoints precisely and with minimum effort advantageous for improved task performance (e.g., faster completion time, fewer errors, less dependence on memory). Many augmented reality (AR) applications are designed to make tasks easier to perform by supplementing a user's first-person view with virtual instructions. For those tasks that benefit from being seen from more than a single viewpoint, AR users typically have to physically relocalize (i.e., move a see-through display and typically themselves since those displays are often head-worn or hand-held) to those additional viewpoints.  However, this physical motion may be costly or difficult, due to increased distances or obstacles in the environment. We have developed a set of interaction techniques that enable fast and accurate task localization in AR. Our first technique, SnapAR, allows users to take snapshots of augmented scenes that can be virtually revisited at later times. The system stores still images of scenes along with camera poses, so that augmentations remain dynamic and interactive. Our prototype implementation features a set of interaction techniques specifically designed to enable quick viewpoint switching. A formal evaluation of the capability to manipulate virtual objects within snapshot mode showed significant savings in time spent and gain in accuracy when compared to physically traveling between viewpoints. For cases when a user has to physically travel to a strategic viewpoint (e.g., to perform maintenance and repair on a large physical piece of equipment), we present ParaFrustum, a geometric construct that represents this set of strategic viewpoints and viewing directions and establishes constraints on a range of acceptable locations for the user's eyes and a range of acceptable angles in which the user's head can be oriented.  Providing tolerance in the allowable viewing positions and directions avoids burdening the user with the need to assume a tightly constrained 6DOF pose when it is not required by the task. We describe two visualization techniques, ParaFrustum-InSitu and ParaFrustum-HUD, that guide a user to assume one of the poses defined by a ParaFrustum. A formal user study corroborated that speed improvements increase with larger tolerances and reveals interesting differences in participant trajectories based on the visualization technique. When the object to be operated on is smaller and can be handheld, instead of being large and stationary, it can be manually rotated instead of the user moving to a strategic viewpoint. Examples of such situations include tasks in which one object must be oriented relative to a second prior to assembly and tasks in which objects must be held in specific ways to inspect them. Researchers have investigated guidance mechanisms for some 6DOF tasks, using wide--field-of-view (FOV), stereoscopic virtual and augmented reality head-worn displays (HWDs).  However, there has been relatively little work directed toward smaller FOV lightweight monoscopic HWDs, such as Google Glass, which may remain more comfortable and less intrusive than stereoscopic HWDs in the near future. In our Orientation Assistance work, we have designed and implemented a novel visualization approach and three additional visualizations representing different paradigms for guiding unconstrained manual 3DOF rotation, targeting these monoscopic HWDs. This chapter includes our exploration of these paradigms and the results of a user study evaluating the relative performance of the visualizations and showing the advantages of our new approach. In summary, we investigated ways of enabling an AR user to obtain visual information from multiple viewpoints, both physically and virtually. In the virtual case, we showed how one can change viewpoints precisely and with less effort. In the physical case, we explored how we can interactively guide users to obtain strategic viewpoints, either by moving their heads or re-orienting handheld objects.  In both cases, we showed that our techniques help users accomplish certain types of tasks more quickly and with fewer errors, compared to when they have to change viewpoints following alternative, previously suggested methods.

/works/OL32577259W;/authors/OL3552088A;Crossing Rivers and Lakes;"This dissertation is a study of cynical practices against a backdrop of increasing censorship and surveillance in Chinese everyday life. It takes a particular view that with its distinctive Chinese shades and hues, cynicism (in this work “wanshi”) as a mode of behavior and an outlook on life is embedded within what is often considered a marginal culture called “rivers and lakes” (jianghu). Oscillating back and forth between utopian vision and political reality, the cynics’ odyssey through space and time began in the imaginary world of jianghu conceived by fourth-century B.C. Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi. The jianghu of his literary creation is allegorically set in nature, a space outside officialdom and social order; only in this world can one truly roam free, unencumbered by constrictive career ambitions and complex human relationships. Jianghu alluded to the lifeworld of a hermit. About six centuries later, Zhuangzi’s vision captured the imagination of the wider intelligentsia in an empire crumbling under social and political turmoil not unlike that of the philosopher.  Jianghu became a cultivated fantasy space among the literary and political elite in the cultural milieu characterized as “aesthetic hermitism”: from the construction of pleasure gardens, to hosting literary salons and drinking parties, to patronizing a hermit to dwell in the private garden for the otherworldly aura and the worldly status it brought to the hosts. Hermits jumped aboard the zeitgeist, moving from mountains and caves initially, to private gardens and later to court and marketplace that were emblematic of power and materialism. By this time, hermitism was no longer defined by the dwelling place, but rather by the inner strength unperturbed by earthly matters and surroundings. Eventually in the Song dynasty (960 – 1219), jianghu evolved into a socialized milieu for not just various misfits and outcasts that had been forced out of the longstanding clan system, but also powerful figures hiding in the imperial court with treacherous ambitions. Of the myriad jianghu figures, storytellers who disseminated historical tales of fraternal love and loyalty in taverns, in the name of righteousness, were key to popularizing the hitherto elite culture.  These deviations from the original jianghu of Zhuangzi’s conception shaped the (a)social character of the emerging cynic, who is at once a realist and a player. This circuitous route to the genealogical line of the cynic affords the facilities and perspectives necessary to examine the contemporary figure of jianghu. Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork in several artist communities in Beijing, particularly Songzhuang, where the artists referred to themselves and their social milieu as intrinsically jianghu, much of this dissertation looks into their lifeworld – conditions of their “habitat”, mode of existence and worldview – and their everyday practices and skills pertaining to agency and communication in order to bypass surveillance, censorship and outright subjugation. Bearing some resemblance to the bygone raconteurs in taverns, the artists’ techniques of coded communication were quickly appropriated and innovated by the general public on the constantly monitored social media and everywhere in cyperspace.  Rather than discuss jianghu as a separate entity from the mainstream society, this work proposes to view it from a “practice” perspective. As such, the last part of the dissertation restages two larger-than-life online battles to reflect upon a range of potentialities of cynical practices as opposed to direct confrontations and ironic expressions in the age of hyperconnectivity."

Dort wurde sie Opfer einer beispiellosen Mobbingkampagne, die sie in den vorzeitigen Ruhestand trieb. Ihr mit Spannung erwartetes Buch ist ein erschütternder Erfahrungsbericht und zugleich ein engagierter Beitrag zur aktuellen Schul- und Bildungsdebatte. Sie spricht aus, welchem Druck Lehrer heute ausgesetzt sind, welche Fehler Behörden, Politiker, Kollegen und Eltern im wichtigsten gesellschaftlichen Bereich - der Erziehung - tagtäglich machen.  Ursula Sarrazin prangert die Gleichgültigkeit der Schulbehörden gegenüber dem aufreibenden Lehreralltag an und wehrt sich vehement gegen die Auslagerung elterlicher Verantwortung an das Bildungssystem: „Wir Lehrer können nicht alle gesellschaftlichen Defizite beheben. Schule ist damit überfordert.“ Sie formuliert aber auch Lösungswege, die alle um ein Ziel kreisen: das nachhaltige Wohl der Kinder.

Now Kyle had to protect his widow, Andrea--who had vowed to kill him on sight. He had to convince her a much larger mission was unraveling before she took matters into her own hands. Evenly matched, could he outmaneuver this woman long enough for all their wounds to heal?

His classmates were often circus children and one of his Junior High School teachers was a member of the famous Wallenda family.    He has successfully pursued a career as a motion picture Producer-Director in Hollywood with such well-known movies as ARMED RESPONSE and INNER SANCTUM to his credit. He is the author of THE NEW POVERTY ROW (McFarland & Co.) and was once a magician, specializing in spectacular, hair-raising escapes. His love for the carnival and its Side Shows led him to create his own traveling exhibit. In doing so he quickly discovered the strange, and often bizarre, world that lurks behind the scenes of the Grind Shows.

/works/OL14958765W;/authors/OL20934A;Alien Sex;From Bernie Goutley's review:    1.)	Her Furry Face by Leigh Kennedy  A primate handler who is in a waning marriage falls for one of his super-intelligent orangutan students.    2.)	War Bride by Rick Wilbur  The world is going to end tomorrow unless you’ve been taken as a pet by one of the aliens.    3.)	How’s the Night Life on Cissalda by Harlan Ellison  A man sent to investigate an alien race becomes inextricably sexually entangled with one of the aliens. Eventually, he’s forcibly separated from the alien—of a race that are apparently thin-skinned—and lives to see the descent of mankind.    4.)	The Jamesburg Incubus by Scott Baker  A teacher in a Catholic school finds that he can make out-of-body nocturnal visits to some of his more attractive female students.    5.)	Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex by Larry Niven  This reads more like an essay than a short story. The work delves into the physics of why sex with Superman would be fatal for Lois Lane.     6.)	The First Time by K.W. Jeter  This is a variation on the old coming of age story in which a young man is taken to a brothel for his first sexual encounter. It’s just that this encounter is of the 3rd kind.     7.)	The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod by Philip José Farmer  The premise behind the story is what if William S. Burroughs (author of Naked Lunch) had written the Tarzan stories instead of Edgar Rice Burroughs. In essence, it’s a risqué take on Tarzan.    8.)	Husbands by Lisa Tuttle   After the extinction of husbands, a woman develops a new species to serve the companion role.    9.)	When the Fathers Go by Bruce McAllister  A husband confesses to his wife that while she was in stasis waiting for him to come back from interplanetary travel, he sired a child with an alien. Furthermore, the child is coming to live with them. But wait there’s more…    10.)	Dancing Chickens by Edward Bryant  This story reads more like an overly elaborate joke than a short story. It begins with the question, “What do aliens want?” and ends with a pun punch line. That being said, the lead is an unappealing but intriguing character.    11.)	Roadside Rescue by Pat Cadigan  A stranded motorist is made an indecent proposal by a chauffeur on behalf of his alien employer.    12.)	Omnisexual by Geoff Ryman  This is about an intergalactic brothel, but it’s the story in the collection that reads most like literary fiction—meant in both the best and worst possible ways.    13.)	All My Darling Daughters by Connie Willis   While there are several really good works in this anthology, I’d have to rank this as my favorite—if only by a narrow victory. A sassy, sexually-liberated co-ed has her sex life torn asunder when all the young men come back from break with little, furry creatures in their possession and no interest in the female student body. Besides a neat concept for a story (though it may be implying that men are overwhelmingly rapey), the author does a great job of character development making the lead character both interesting and likable, while juxtaposing her with her apparently goodie two-shoes roommate.     14.)	Arousal by Richard Christian Matheson  A woman who cheats on her husband with a stranger is cursed with permanent post-coital euphoria that swamps all interest in her family and life in general.    15.)	Scales by Lewis Shiner  A woman’s husband is having an affair with what she thinks is a student assistant, but who turns out to be a soul-sucking seductress from the netherworld.    16.)	Saving the World at the New Moon Hotel by Roberta Lannes  A woman waiting for her spouse to meet her at a bar to apologize for his infidelities decides to get a little herself. The man she hooks up with turns out not to be a man at all.    17.)	And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill’s Side James Tiptree, Jr.   An experienced man offers advice to a newbie to get away before he ends up seduced by the aliens. This story talks about sex, but is about something much broader.    18.)	Picture Planes Michaela Roessner  This one is a poem about alien sex, rather than a story. It stands alone as the only non-prose entry.    19.)	Love and Sex Among the Invertebrates Pat Murphy  In a post-apocalyptic world, a dying scientist--who no longer believes in science--creates robots capable of engaging in the act. The creatures she makes are based on a range of real animals which are written about interspersed with the story-line.

I captured the instances, the lights, the children's laughter- Today I have released them in a book. My first book of photographs. As a photographer, I think today's the need to share my view. Print my images, do not abandon them on a hard disk, touch and travel with them again, it is a form of abatement. A way of giving birth to a part of oneself that one offers to others. For me, consigning my photographer's emotions and my regard in a book is also and above all - fabricating an object. An object which has the sense, which gathers, which offers, transmits, guards precisely. 'Elsewhere' is this object. ""- Xavier Istasse.  J'ai pris des centaines de photos dans ma vie, au gré de mes envies, au fil de mes voyages, de mes rencontres. J'ai capturé des instants, des lumières, des rires d'enfants- Aujourd'hui je les libère dans un livre. Mon premier livre de photographies. En tant que photographe, je ressens aujourd'hui le besoin de partager mon regard. Imprimer mes images, ne pas les abandonner sur un disque dur, les toucher et voyager à nouveau avec elles, c'est une forme d'aboutissement. Une manière de donner naissance à une partie de soi que l'on offre aux autres. Pour moi, consigner mes émotions de photographe et mon regard dans un livre c'est aussi et surtout - fabriquer un objet. Un objet qui a du sens, qui rassemble, qui s'offre, se transmet, se garde précieusement. 'Ailleurs' est cet objet.""- Xavier Istasse."

/works/OL33045054W;/authors/OL11923476A;Stars and dragons;China and Europe are two of the world's most ancient civilisations. They will be two of the most important international actors shaping the 21st century. Of the world population of 6.7 billion people, China accounts for 1.3 billion and the EU 0.5 billion. With India (1.1 billion) and the United States (0.3 billion) the four entities account for just under half of all mankind. The EU's single market is the largest economy in the world. China's economy is number three, but has been growing at a rate of some 10% a year. The US economy is second. China's largest trading partner is the EU. China, the United States and the EU together account for 55% of global emissions of carbon dioxide. The eastern hemisphere is growing faster in terms of economy, population and emissions than the west. As was shown at the Copenhagen climate change conference in 2009, the balance of global power is moving strongly eastwards and southwards. We are moving rapidly towards a multi-polar world, but with key players. Though it will not compete with the US in hard power, the EU aspires to be one of them. That was part of the rationale for the Lisbon Treaty. Without resolving its relationship with China, the EU cannot achieve its aims.
/works/OL32826459W;/authors/OL11923476A;The future of EU enlargement;The enlargement process has, historically and in successive Treaties, been understood as an integral part of the European Union's development. 40 years after the first enlargement, which brought the UK, Ireland and Denmark into the then European Community, the EU is about to accept its 28th Member State, Croatia. With eight further countries either already candidates or potential candidates, the EU's enlargement agenda shows no sign of halting. Yet further enlargement will not be easy, either for the Union or for the candidate countries. This report considers the process by which aspirant countries, that is, the EU's candidate and potential candidate countries' progress towards readiness for membership.

It aims to teach the player insight into the geopolitical arena by either playing the President of the US or the Secretary General of Russia. The book, written by the lead programmer, describes in a clear style the game rules and processes, and provides a valuable insight into the mind of a game designer. Its focuses on the four main challenges of the game: insurgencies, coup d'etat, Finlandization, and crisis, addressing each of these aspects in detail. Interestingly, the main concepts still apply in 2010.  The author has made the text available online too: http://www.erasmatazz.com/page78/page146/page147/BalanceOfPower.html

/works/OL20932985W;/authors/OL3377100A;What does the honeybee see? And how do we know?;This book is the only account of what the bee, as an example of an insect, actually detects with its eyes. Bees detect some visual features such as edges and colours, but there is no sign that they reconstruct patterns or put together features to form objects. Bees detect motion but have no perception of what it is that moves, and certainly they do not recognize ?things? by their shapes. Yet they clearly see well enough to fly and find food with a minute brain. Bee vision is therefore relevant to the construction of simple artificial visual systems, for example for mobile robots. The surprising conclusion is that bee vision is adapted to the recognition of places, not things. In this volume, Adrian Horridge also sets out the curious and contentious history of how bee vision came to be understood, with an account of a century of neglect of old experimental results, errors of interpretation, sharp disagreements, and failures of the scientific method. The design of the experiments and the methods of making inferences from observations are also critically examined, with the conclusion that scientists are often hesitant, imperfect and misleading, ignore the work of others, and fail to consider alternative explanations. The erratic path to understanding makes interesting reading for anyone with an analytical mind who thinks about the methods of science or the engineering of seeing machines.

During this period the Maya abandoned their power centers in the southern lowlands and rather abruptly ceased the distinctive cultural practices that marked their apogee in the Classic period. Archaeological fieldwork during the past three decades, however, has uncovered enormous regional variability in the ways the Maya experienced the shift from Classic to Postclassic society, revealing a period of cultural change more complex than acknowledged by traditional models."" ""Featuring an impressive roster of scholars, The Terminal Classic in the Maya Lowlands presents the most recent data and interpretations pertaining to this perplexing period of cultural transformation in the Maya lowlands. Although the research reveals clear interregional patterns, the contributors resist a single overarching explanation. Rather, this volume's diverse and nuanced interpretations provide a new, more properly grounded beginning for continued debate on the nature of lowland Terminal Classic Maya civilization.

(It had not). |     | Immediately Bea’s investigative instincts kicked in. Why would any reasonably sane robber leave such valuable items? It didn’t make sense. |     | The Cousins were called and the search party was formed. |     | Join the Pugs on this confusing search for the thief. |     | Be there for the awkward moment whey they discover the intruder’s identity. |     | Experience the unusual directions Bea gives the Pugs and see the baffling procedure that she uses to catch the villain. |     | Endure Bea’s unusual loss of appetite. |     | Witness the upheaval of three pugs being deputised. |     | Watch the haphazard procedure Bea uses to form a search party and try to follow her muddled directions. |     | The ending will thrill and astound you. |     | http://www.Lelabree. com |

An explanation is that shorter children experienced greater mortality and that this selection offset stunting. We disentangle stunting and selection effects of the Chinese famine, using the height of the children of the famine cohort. We find significant stunting of about 2cm for rural females and slightly less for rural males who experienced the famine in the first five years of life. Our results suggest that mortality bias implies that raw height is not always a good measure of economic conditions during childhood""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

Her origin story comes alive in Okay, Universe. This captivating graphic novel—created in a true collaboration with Governor-General Award-winner Delphie Côté-Lacroix—follows her journey from community organizer and volunteer to municipal candidate, and the phone call from the local social justice political party that changed her life forever.    Okay, Universe is the first time Plante has told her story, and she has chosen an art form that is not just emblematic of the city of Montreal and its love of the arts and bande dessinée, it’s an art form that is accessible to all readers and perfectly suited to her message. With patience, determination, and the strength of will to remain true to her core beliefs, Okay, Universe details the inspiring political campaign where slowly but surely she gained the trust of a neighbourhood fighting for affordable housing, environmental protections, and equal opportunities. Okay, Universe demystifies the path to success, simultaneously showing the Mayor’s inextinguishable commitment to creating positive change in the world and educating about the vitality of political engagement.
